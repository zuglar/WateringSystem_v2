Just move the sketch .fzz file to Macos. Any parts not in core parts in the sketch are included in the .fzz file and will appear in the temp parts bin in Macos.

*************************************

To move the parts in your mine parts bin across you need to right click on them in Debian then select export part to get a .fzpz file of the part. 
You then need to move the .fzpz file to Macos and either double click in it to load the part or in Fritzing do File->load->filename.fzpz 
to load it in to the mine parts bin and then when exiting Fritzing select save new parts and save changes to the parts bin to save the parts in the mine parts bin. 
The .fzz file should have the appropriate custom parts in it and load them in to the temp parts bin. 
Upload the .fzz file (upload is 7th icon from the left in the reply menu) and I can try it on Windows to see if there is something wrong with the .fzz file.
