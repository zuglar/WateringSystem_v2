There are 34 distinct GPIOs available on the ESP32. They are identified as:
• GPIO_NUM_0 – GPIO_NUM_19
• GPIO_NUM_21 – GPIO_NUM_23
• GPIO_NUM_25 – GPIO_NUM_27
• GPIO_NUM_32 – GPIO_NUM_39
The ones that are omitted are 20, 24, 28, 29, 30 and 31.
Note that GPIO_NUM_34 – GPIO_NUM_39 are input mode only. You can not use these pins
for signal output. Also, pins 6 (SD_CLK), 7 (SD_DATA0), 8 (SD_DATA1), 9
(SD_DATA2), 10 (SD_DATA3), 11 (SD_CMD) 16 (CS) and 17(Q) are used to interact
with the SPI flash chip … you can not use those for other purposes.
When using pSRAM,
Strapping pins are GPIO0, GPIO2 and GPIO12.
TX and RX (as used for flash) are GPIO1 and GPIO3.
The data type called gpio_num_t is a C language enumeration with values
corresponding to these names. It is recommended to use these values rather than
attempt to use numeric values.
